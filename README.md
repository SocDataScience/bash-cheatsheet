# Bash Cheat Sheet 
Most important bash commands for researchers and data scientists. 

The set-up of this cheat sheet is inspired by an existing [cheat sheet](https://github.com/tiimgreen/github-cheat-sheet) by [Tim Green](https://github.com/tiimgreen).

## Managing processes
### First-aid procedure for killing a running process
* open new terminal window
* type `ps + enter`
* identify PID (processid) of the process
* type `kill -9 <PID>`

OR:
* `control + C` (twice if needed)

### Cronjobs and Crontab
#### Schedule crontab task
* If you want to run the cronjob on a server: enter the server
* enter `crontab -e` in the terminal
* enter `<minutes> <hours> <day of month> <month> <day of week>`
 * for example `6 0 * * 1-6 cd /home/annerose/Python/continuousscraper/ && python processcontrol.py new`
 * this signifies that the process will start to run Monday through Saturday at 6 minutes past midnight.

#### Kill an existing cronjob
* enter `ps -e` in the terminal to see all existing processes.
* termine which processid your process has.
* enter `kill -9 <processid>`

### Virtual environments
Change virtual environment: 

```bash
workon <name of virtual environment>
workon annerose2015-11  # python 2 environment
workon annerose_python3_2016-07 # python 3 environment
```

How to set up and manage virtual environments in Ubuntu:   [http://askubuntu.com/questions/244641/how-to-set-up-and-use-a-virtual-python-environment-in-ubuntu](http://askubuntu.com/questions/244641/how-to-set-up-and-use-a-virtual-python-environment-in-ubuntu)

### Tmux sessions
Tmux allows to keep processes running after ending an ssh session. For more detailed explanation, see [here](http://askubuntu.com/questions/8653/how-to-keep-processes-running-after-ending-ssh-session).

* ssh into the remote machine
* start tmux by typing `tmux` into the shell
* start the process you want inside the started tmux session
* leave/detach the tmux session by typing `Ctrl+B` and then `D`

You can now safely logoff from the remote machine, your process will keep running inside tmux. When you come back again and want to check the status of your process you can use `tmux attach` to attach to your tmux session.

If you want to have multiple session running side-by-side you should name each session using `Ctrl-B` and `$`. You can get a list of the currently running sessions using `tmux list-sessions`.

Some more useful tmux commands (see also this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHhA_ZKjyxo)):

* control + -b <command> to tell the shell that itâ€™s for tmux and not just normal shell. 

* `control + -b  p` : previous window
* `control + -b  n` : next window
* `control + -b  c` : create window
* `control + -b  w` : list windows
* `control + -b %` : split window vertically into two parts
* `control + -b` : split-horizontally : split window horizontally
* `tmux - new s <sessionname>` : create a new tmux session
* `control + -x`  : close (kill) tmux pane

* `control + -b d` : detach from tmux session. (without stopping the process). 
* `tmux list-sessions` : List all tmux sessions. 
* `tmux attach -t <sessionname>` : attach to a certain tmux session
* `tmux attach` : attach all tmux sessions/ any tmux session


***
## R
* Open new RStudio window from terminal (e.g. when one RStudio needs to run for an extended period of time):
 * enter `open -n -a "rstudio"` in terminal

***
## Text editing and LaTeX
### Calculate the number of words in a Latex file
* change the working directory of your terminal to where the LaTeX TeX file is located.
* enter `detex <document_name>.tex | wc -w -c -l` or just `detex <document_name>.tex | wc`
* to calculate word count in pdf document: `pdftotext <document_name>.pdf - | wc -w`
